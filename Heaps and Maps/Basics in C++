 C++ Standard Template Library provides maps and sets which are implemented > internally using balanced red black trees. We explore maps here for now, although set is very much similar. 
Map declaration :
    map<int, int> A; // O(1) declaration which declares an empty tree map.
Insert a new key, value pair K, V:
    A[K] = V; // O(log n). Note that we expect key K to be unique here. If you have keys that will repeat, take a look at multimaps. 
Delete a key K:
    A.erase(K); // O(log n)
Search if a key K exists in map:
    A.find(K) != A.end()  // O(log n)
Search for the value with key K:
     A[K]     // O(log n)
Find minimum key K in the map ( if the map is not empty ) :
    (A.begin())->first     // O(1)
Find maximum key K in the map ( if map is not empty ) :
    (A.rbegin())->first     // O(1)
Iterate over keys in sorted order :
    for (map<int,int>::iterator it = A.begin(); it != A.end(); ++it) {
        // it->first has the key, it->second has the value. 
    }
Find closest key K > x :
    (A.upper_bound(x))->first     // O(log n). Do need to handle the case when x is more than or equal to the max key in the map. 
Find closest key K >= x :
    (A.lower_bound(x))->first     // O(log n). Do need to handle the case when x is more than the max key in the map.
Size ( number of entries in the map ) :
    A.size()
